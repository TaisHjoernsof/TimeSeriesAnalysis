# Time Series Analysis (02417, DTU)

This repository contains the code and results for **Assignment 1** through **Assignment 4** from the course _Time Series Analysis_ (02417, DTU).

All assignments were implemented in **R**, with some visualization and post-processing in **Python**.

## Assignment 1

This assignment focuses on linear trend modeling and adaptive estimation methods. Techniques include ordinary least squares (OLS), weighted least squares (WLS), and recursive least squares (RLS) with forgetting. The objective was to forecast vehicle registrations in Denmark using a time-adaptive modeling approach and to compare the effectiveness of each estimation method.

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, various ARMA and seasonal time series models are simulated and analyzed. Tasks include evaluating stationarity, examining autocorrelation behavior, and identifying model structures based on ACF and PACF plots. The exercise builds intuition for model behavior through hands-on simulation and pattern recognition.

## Assignment 3

This assignment introduces seasonal AR models for forecasting monthly solar power and ARX transfer function models for predicting the heating load of a test box. Key components include model validation, multi-step prediction, and impulse response estimation. The ARX modeling builds on system identification techniques to evaluate the impact of weather variables on heat demand.

## Assignment 4

The final assignment applies the **Kalman filter** for parameter estimation in state-space models. It covers both 1D and 2D models, explores robustness under non-Gaussian noise, and includes a practical application forecasting temperature dynamics in a transformer station using weather and load data.

## Documentation & Reproducibility

Each task is structured as a standalone report (PDF) with explanations, plots, and results. The core logic is split into scripts per question/task. Interpretations and reflections are found in the respective reports.
